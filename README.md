# Diwali Sales Insights

## Project Objective:
To analyze Diwali sales data to identify trends, consumer behavior, and provide valuable insights to enhance decision-making and strategic planning for businesses.

## Data Sources & Queries:
-	Data Source: Diwali sales data containing information about sales transactions, customer demographics, product categories, and more.
-	Key Queries:
   - Total sales and revenue during Diwali
   - Sales trends by product category, customer demographic, and location
   - Top-selling products and customer segment.
   - Customer behavior analysis (e.g., purchase frequency, average order value)
   - Comparison of Diwali sales with non-Diwali sales

## Python Libraries:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Seaborn: For statistical visualizations.   

## Data Set Used:
<a href="https://github.com/Simran0721/Analyzing-Diwali-Sales-Data/blob/main/Diwali%20Sales%20Data.csv">DataSet</a>

Diwali sales data with 11,251 rows and 15 columns.

## Questions (KPIs):
- Top-selling product categories: Analyze sales data by product category to identify the most popular ones during Diwali.
- Sales variation by demographics: Group and compare sales data by customer demographics like age, gender, and location to see how these factors influence buying behavior.
- Customer behavior trends: Look for patterns in customer purchases during Diwali. This might involve analyzing average order value, purchase frequency, or types of products bought together.
- Diwali vs. non-Diwali sales: Compare sales figures from the Diwali period with data from a non-Diwali period to understand the sales increase during the festival.
- Implications for businesses: Based on the findings, businesses can identify target customer segments, optimize product offerings for Diwali, and develop targeted marketing strategies to boost sales during the festive season.

## Process:
1.	Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame and clean it by handling missing values and duplicates.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the data using descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis.
3.	Data Analysis: Perform specific analysis to answer the defined questions (e.g., calculate sales by category, analyze customer demographics, compare Diwali vs. non-Diwali sales).
4.	Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, pie charts) to represent the findings.
5.	Insight Generation: Draw conclusions and generate insights based on the analysis.
6.	Recommendation: Provide recommendations for businesses based on the insights.

## Project Insight:
- The project will help businesses understand customer behavior during Diwali and identify opportunities to increase sales.
- By analyzing sales trends and customer preferences, businesses can optimize their product offerings, marketing strategies, and inventory management.

## Final Conclusion:
- The project successfully provides valuable insights into Diwali sales trends and consumer behavior.
- The findings can be used by businesses to enhance their Diwali marketing strategies and improve sales performance.
- The Python code can be shared on GitHub to contribute to the open-source community.
